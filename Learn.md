# 👩‍💻 What You’ll Learn from CPUSchedPlusPlus

CPUSchedPlusPlus is a beginner-friendly C++ project that visually demonstrates how various CPU scheduling algorithms work using console output. It's a perfect hands-on resource for students, educators, and interview prep.

<br/>

## 🔍 Core Concepts Covered

- **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - Priority Scheduling 
  - Round Robin

- **Gantt Chart Simulation**: Understand execution timelines through textual Gantt charts.

- **Data Structures**: Learn how arrays, structs, and basic sorting/queuing are used in algorithmic logic.

- **C++ Skills**:
  - Working with input/output
  - Conditional logic & loops
  - Structuring modular code
  - Building CLI tools

<br/>

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Computer Science students learning OS concepts
- Developers revising for technical interviews
- Teachers seeking a demo-ready example for labs
- Beginners exploring how to apply C++ for core CS problems

<br/>

## 💡 How It Helps

Understanding scheduling through dry theory alone can be tough. CPUSchedPlusPlus bridges the gap between **concept and code** — helping you grasp not just how each algorithm works, but also **why** one may be better suited in a given scenario.

Use this project to **visualize**, **experiment**, and **master** the foundational concepts of process scheduling.

## 📚 Suggested Learning Path

If you're just getting started with Operating Systems, here’s how this project fits into your learning:

1. **Watch** a basic tutorial on CPU Scheduling (e.g., [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIY8eNdw5tW_lHyageTADFKBt9weJXndE)).
2. **Read** about each algorithm on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/).
3. **Run** the CPUSchedPlusPlus project and test different inputs.
4. **Analyze** how the output changes with burst times, priorities, and time quantum.
5. **Experiment** by tweaking the code (e.g., add IO time or new scheduling logic).

This project is a great stepping stone before jumping into OS simulators or system-level programming.
